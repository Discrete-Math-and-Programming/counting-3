# Basics of counting 2

## Reading

* [Levin's 3.2](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/dmoi-4/sec_counting-combine-outcomes.html) and [3.3](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/dmoi-4/sec_counting-non-disjoint.html).
* Solve the exercises of the chapters. You can ask in class those that challenged you. Lack of questions means you understood the material.

## Coding

Please use, as the need arises, the functions you have implemented in the
previous assignments. Put your modules (= Python files) in the `lib` directory
and import from there.

* Given a set represented as a list (we will assume there are no repetitions),
    return the set of its subsets as a list of lists. 

    Your are required to solve the problem both with a recursive and an iterative approach.
